## üîß Specific AI Contributions

### **Enterprise Patterns Implementation**
```kotlin
// AI helped design this reactive state management pattern
combine(
    repository.expenses,
    repository.getTotalExpenses(),
    _searchQuery,
    _selectedCategory,
    _groupBy,
    _dateFilter
) { expenses, total, query, category, groupBy, dateFilter ->
    // Automatic reactive state computation
    ExpenseUiState(...)
}.collect { state ->
    _uiState.value = state
}
```

### **Type-Safe Navigation System**
```kotlin
// AI designed this enterprise navigation pattern
sealed class ExpenseDestination(val route: String) {
    object Home : ExpenseDestination("home")
    object ExpenseList : ExpenseDestination("expense_list") {
        fun createRoute(dateFilter: String? = null): String {
            // Type-safe route generation
        }
    }
}
```

### **Advanced UI Components**
```kotlin
// AI helped create this sophisticated chart component
@Composable
fun DailyExpenseChart(dailyData: List<DailyExpenseData>) {
    // Custom Compose-based visualization
    // Responsive design with proper scaling
    // Material Design 3 theming integration
}
```

AI suggested implementing smart duplicate detection:
```kotlin
private suspend fun checkForDuplicateExpense(
    title: String,
    amount: Double,
    category: Category
): Boolean {
    // Intelligent duplicate detection logic
    // Used by financial apps like Mint and YNAB
}
```

### **Theme Management System**
AI designed a comprehensive theme system:
```kotlin
class ThemeViewModel : ViewModel() {
    // System-aware theme switching
    // Persistence-ready architecture
    // Reactive theme updates
}
```

### **Advanced Filtering System**
AI created sophisticated filtering capabilities:
```kotlin
// Multi-dimensional filtering with reactive updates
// Date range, category, search, and grouping
// Real-time UI updates without manual refresh
```
