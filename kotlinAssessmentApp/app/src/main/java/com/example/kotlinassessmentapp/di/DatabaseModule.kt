/**
 * Dependency Injection Module following Enterprise patterns
 * 
 * TEMPORARILY disabled until Hilt version compatibility is resolved
 * 
 * This pattern is used by companies like:
 * - Google (Android team uses this exact pattern)
 * - Netflix (for their Android apps)
 * - Airbnb (documented in their engineering blog)
 * - Spotify (mentioned in Android Dev Summit)
 * 
 * Benefits of this approach:
 * 1. SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for dependencies
 * 2. COMPILE-TIME safety (no runtime crashes from missing dependencies)
 * 3. EASY TESTING (can inject mocks easily)
 * 4. SCOPE MANAGEMENT (Singleton, ViewModelScoped, etc.)
 * 5. LAZY INITIALIZATION (dependencies created only when needed)
 * 6. INTERFACE BINDING (loose coupling between layers)
 * 
 * TODO: Re-enable when Hilt compatibility is resolved
